## Project Title: Weather Data Analytics Project.

**Task Overview:** The purpose of this project is to analyze the available data that shows the model of cars, their make, what the engine is made up of, and other factors that governs the Car. the Data is of Different Cars and their specification

   The Data was made available by Wanda for this Project, It is saved in a csv file with the name "CarsDataset".

## Project Objectives:
This project will focus on analyzing Cars data without a specific date range. We are looking to understand;
 > The demographics of the cars model, How much KPG does most set of buyers purchase their cars, How long a model is well informed, How goo are the cars, How much of sales have they been making, etc.
 
If there's any chance for further question, there will be space to answer them.

## Data Column Details.
Here are the names of the column with a brief info

+ Make: This column contains the make of the cars (e.g Acura, Accord, Audi, etc.)
+ Model: This is the model of the car based on the make of the car, often times different cars can have the same model.
+ Type: This id the type of car the model falls under. for example, Sudan, SUV, Sports.
+ Origin: This Shows the Continent that the Car make originated from.
+ DriveTrain: This considers the wheels of the car. whether it is a foul wheel drive or just carry only the front.
+ MSRP: This is known as the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price. Its is the price that a manufacturer recommends for stores to sell their product.
+ Invoice: This should be the cost price of the Car make.
+ EngineSize: This is the size of the engine, ranging from 1.3 to 8.3.
+ Cylinders: This measures the cylinders of the car.
+ Horsepower: This column shows the entire horse power of the car make. The least is seen as 73.
+ MPG_City: This shows the miles per gallon of the car make when running on city roads.
+ MPG_Highway: This shoes the miles per gallon of the car make when running on Highway roads.
+ Weight: This shows the weight of the car in KG.
+ Wheelbase:....
+ Length: The length of the car in centimeters.

## Business Requirements/Task Overview:
 *We would want to first analyze the data-frame to view some column aggregation, looking at the summary, count of null values, number of unique values in a column, etc.*
 #### After Satisfying the above, we can then head into solving the tasks below.
 1. Find all Null Values in the dataset. If there is any null value in any column, then fill it with the mean of that column.
 2. Check what are the different types of Make are there in our dataset. And, what is the count (occurrence) of each Make in the data?
 3. Show all the records where Origin is Asia or Europe.
 4. Remove all the records (rows) where Weight is above 4000.
 5. Increase all the values of 'MPG_City' column by 3.
 
 ## Deliverables:
+ A  Python Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the Cars Dataset
+ An interactive dashboard containing important KPI's and the rest of unanswered questions from the Cars dataset.
+ An  R Script containing generated coding for showing insights on the Cars Dataset
+ A report containing insights on Weather Dataset (e.g Unique Weather Numbers, Filtered Table, etc.)

## Constraints:
- The data cannot be shared with unauthorized personnel.
- The data cannot be modified or altered in any way.
- The project must comply with data privacy regulations.
- The project must be completed within the allocated time and budget.

## Conclusion
The data analytics project for Cars is an important initiative that will help the Project Manager to understand The most used cars and other info's as well. The external consultant will work closely with the Project team to ensure that the project is successful and delivers the expected results.
